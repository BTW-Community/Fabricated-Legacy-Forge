# Fabricated ModLoader

Load ModLoader mods as if they were FabricLoader mods.

Currently, only mod folder mods are supported, mods with class edits are unsupported for now.

Supported Minecraft versions: 1.3.2.

### Working Mods
- [CakeIsALie](https://mcarchive.net/mods/cakeisalie)
- [Fog Key](https://mcarchive.net/mods/fog-key)
- [Inventory Tweaks](https://mcarchive.net/mods/invtweaks) (the mod localization doesn't work.)

- [Rei's Minimap](https://mcarchive.net/mods/reiminimap) (Works/Doesn't randomly.)

- [Pfaeffs Mod](https://mcarchive.net/mods/asdf) (Loads but I'm not sure what it does.)

### TODO
- Implement fix for mods supposed to work.
- Add ModLoaderMP support.
